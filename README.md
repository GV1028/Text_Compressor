# Text_Compressor
A web application built using R for efficient text compression using frequent pattern mining.
This web application uses a new version of huffman encoding where in codes are assigned to patterns. The Closed Frequent Itemsets are mined 
using an advanced modified version of the A-Close Algorithm. And then these itemsets are then encoded.
